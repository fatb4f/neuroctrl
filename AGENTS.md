# AGENTS.md (repo)

## Working agreements
- Prefer mechanical checks over narrative claims.
- Keep changes inside the allowed packet scope for the current task.
- When adding generated views (e.g., Mermaid), add a regen script and enforce regen-and-compare.

## Repo structure
- Packet contracts live under `control/packet/`.
- Codex skills live under `.codex/skills/`.
