# .codex/packet

This directory contains **packet SSOT assets** (templates, shared checklists) that are useful across
packet contracts and Codex skills.

- Use `packet_contract.template.md` as the starting template for new packet contracts.
- Keep packet-specific skills under `.codex/skills/<packet-id-or-name>/`.

Note: Codex discovers skills under `.codex/skills/` (not `.codex/packet/`).
